<H1>Image2ASCII</H1>
The program uses the PIL library to convert the images into black and white. Then it is converted into a matrix of pixel intensity and converted into ASCII
symbols with the appropiate image size formatting.

To test the code it can be executed directly from the console using the forward command:
```
python ./main.py "image_location"
```
For exaple:
```
python ./main.py "ali.jpg"
```
